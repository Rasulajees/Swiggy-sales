# Swiggy Sales SQL Case Study

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Swiggy's sales data using SQL. The goal was to derive meaningful insights that can guide business decisions. It involved working with multiple tables and executing complex SQL queries, including joins, aggregations, and subqueries.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Extract insights on customer behavior and restaurant performance
- Analyze order patterns and city-based metrics
- Identify delivery trends and operational efficiencies
- Solve 13 business-critical queries using SQL

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Creation
A relational database was created containing the following tables:
- **Customers**
- **Restaurants**
- **Orders**
- **Delivery_Partners**
- **Order_Details**

Each table was populated with sample data to simulate a real-world Swiggy dataset. Foreign keys were defined to maintain relational integrity.

---

## üß± Table Creation
SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements were used to define schema with appropriate data types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Restaurants (
    restaurant_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    rating FLOAT
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    restaurant_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    delivery_partner_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id) REFERENCES Restaurants(restaurant_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Delivery_Partners (
    partner_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
```
